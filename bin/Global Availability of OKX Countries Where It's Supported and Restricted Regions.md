## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  

### **Why is OKX restricted in some countries?**  
Restrictions stem from local financial regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) laws, or international sanctions. For example, the U.S. imposes strict crypto licensing requirements, while the EU enforces MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations.  

### **How can I check if OKX is available in my country?**  
Visit OKX's official website or contact their support team. The platform also conducts automated location checks during account registration.  

### **Are there workarounds for restricted regions?**  
No. OKX employs IP address tracking and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to enforce compliance. Attempting to bypass restrictions violates their terms of service.  

### **What happens if my country's status changes?**  
OKX regularly updates its service map based on regulatory developments. Subscribers can receive alerts via OKX's social media channels or email newsletters.  

### **Can residents in restricted countries use OKX for crypto-to-crypto trading?**  
Residents in fully restricted regions (e.g., Iran) cannot access any services. Those in partially restricted areas (e.g., Netherlands) may trade crypto-to-crypto but cannot use fiat currencies.
