# How to Get Paid in Crypto: Automating Conversions with OnJuno and Ledger  

Cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating, but traditional payroll systems remain stuck in fiat currency. For those seeking to integrate crypto into their financial lives, manually converting paychecks to digital assets creates friction through time consumption, security risks, and excessive fees. This article explores how OnJuno's innovative partnership with Ledger Live solves these challenges through automated conversions, direct hardware wallet integration, and transparent fee structures.  

## The Payroll Problem in Web3  

Despite crypto's growing utility for savings, DeFi participation, and censorship-resistant transactions, most workers still receive salaries in government-issued currencies. Converting fiat to crypto manually creates three key pain points:  

### 1. Time-Consuming Processes  
Traditional methods require:  
- Logging into exchanges  
- Initiating fiat-to-crypto transfers  
- Manual wallet migrations  
This multi-step process must be repeated monthly, consuming valuable time.  

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities  
Exchange wallets expose users to:  
- Counterparty risks (hacks, insolvency)  
- Lack of private key control  
- Regulatory uncertainties  

### 3. Hidden Costs  
Typical fees include:  
| Fee Type            | Description                          |  
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Exchange transaction | 0.1%-1.5% per trade                  |  
| Blockchain gas       | Variable based on network congestion |  
| Wallet transfers     | 1-3% for cross-platform migrations   |

| Traditional Exchange  | 3-5%         | Low            | No         |  
| OnJuno + Ledger       | 1%           | High           | Yes        |
