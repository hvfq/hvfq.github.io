## Risk Factors and Market Considerations  

While projections appear optimistic, investors should consider:  
- **Regulatory Shifts**: Potential restrictions on tokenized fan engagement models  
- **Competitive Pressure**: Emergence of alternative sports blockchain platforms  
- **Crypto Market Volatility**: Correlation with Bitcoinâ€™s price cycles  

## Strategic Investment Approaches
