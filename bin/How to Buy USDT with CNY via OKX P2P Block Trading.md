## Market Trends and USDT Adoption  

Tether (USDT) remains the most widely used stablecoin, with a market cap exceeding $80 billion. Its peg to the US dollar makes it a preferred medium for cross-border transactions, hedging volatility, and remittances. In China, demand for **buying USDT with CNY** has surged due to:  
- Capital controls restricting foreign currency access.  
- The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications denominated in USDT.  
- Arbitrage opportunities between onshore and offshore crypto markets.  

OKX's P2P Block Trading platform capitalizes on these trends by offering localized payment options and a user-friendly interface tailored for Chinese traders.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies  

While block trading minimizes slippage and counterparty risk, traders should still consider:  
- **Price Volatility**: Sudden market movements may impact settlement values.  
- **Payment Delays**: Fiat transfers can take hours to clear during peak periods.  
- **Regulatory Changes**: Stay informed about evolving crypto policies in China and other jurisdictions.  

To mitigate these risks, OKX recommends:  
- Using limit orders to cap price exposure.  
- Selecting counterparties with high trust scores.  
- Monitoring global crypto news and regulatory updates.
