# How to Add GateChain to MetaMask  

MetaMask is one of the most popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and manage digital assets across multiple blockchains. GateChain, a high-performance EVM-compatible blockchain launched by Gate.io, offers fast transaction speeds and low fees. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating GateChain into MetaMask while exploring its unique features, including the GT token, HipoSwap DEX, and advanced wallet functionalities.  

## Understanding GateChain  

**GateChain** is a blockchain network developed by the Gate.io exchange team, launched in 2020. Built as a full EVM-compatible chain, it supports seamless interoperability with networks like Ethereum, BSC, and Fantom. Key advantages include:  

- **High Throughput**: Processes up to **2,000 transactions per second (TPS)** with **4-second block finality**.  
- **EVM Compatibility**: Enables easy migration of dApps and assets from other EVM chains.  
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Facilitates asset transfers between blockchains.  

GateChainâ€™s architecture prioritizes scalability and speed, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) and high-frequency transactions.  

## GateChain Ecosystem Overview  

### GT Token: Utility and Governance  
The **GT token** serves as GateChainâ€™s native utility and governance token. Its primary use cases include:  
- **Transaction Fees**: Paying for network transactions.  
- **Staking**: Securing the network via Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and earning rewards.  
- **Governance**: Participating in protocol decisions.  
- **Exchange Benefits**: Discounted trading fees on Gate.io and access to token sales.  

With a capped supply of 300 million tokens, GT plays a central role in maintaining GateChainâ€™s ecosystem.  

### HipoSwap DEX: DeFi Hub  
**HipoSwap**, GateChainâ€™s native decentralized exchange, offers:  
- **Token Swaps**: Trade GT and other EVM-compatible tokens.  
- **Liquidity Pools**: Earn yields by providing liquidity.  
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Transfer assets between GateChain and other EVM networks.  

HipoSwapâ€™s multi-asset approach makes it a cornerstone for DeFi users on GateChain.  

### GateChain Vault: Enhanced Security  
The **Vault Account** feature introduces a revocable transaction model with delayed execution. Users can bind a standard account as a backup, reducing risks from private key loss or theft.  

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Consensus  

GateChain secures its network through DPoS, where GT token holders can:  
- **Delegate Tokens**: Earn staking rewards by delegating to validators.  
- **Run a Validator**: Requires a significant GT stake and technical expertise.  

Staking incentivizes network participation while maintaining decentralization.  

## How to Buy GT Tokens  

To use GateChain, acquire GT tokens through:  
- **Centralized Exchanges**: Gate.io, Huobi, Bitfinex.  
- **Decentralized Exchanges**: Uniswap, SushiSwap (ERC-20 GT), and HipoSwap.

## GateChain Wallet Integration  

While few wallets natively support GateChain, its EVM compatibility allows manual integration into popular wallets like MetaMask.  

## Step-by-Step Guide: Adding GateChain to MetaMask  

1. **Install MetaMask**: If not already installed, download the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/) or mobile app.  
2. **Open Network Settings**:  
   - Desktop: Click the network dropdown (top-left) > "Add Network."  
   - Mobile: Tap the wallet icon > "Networks" > "Add Network."  
3. **Input GateChain Parameters**:  

| Field                | Value                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Network Name**     | GateChain                 |
| **RPC URL**          | https://evm.gatenode.cc   |
| **Chain ID**         | 86                        |
| **Currency Symbol**  | GT                        |
| **Block Explorer**   | https://www.gatescan.org  |

4. **Save and Confirm**: Click "Save" to add GateChain to your wallet.  

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### 1. How do I verify GateChain integration in MetaMask?  
After saving, check the network dropdown in MetaMask. GateChain should appear in the list. Send a small GT transaction to confirm functionality.  

### 2. Can I use other wallets for GateChain?  
Yes! GateChain works with any EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet) by manually adding the network parameters.  

### 3. What are GateChainâ€™s transaction fees?  
Fees are significantly lower than Ethereum due to high TPS. Costs vary based on network congestion but typically range from $0.001 to $0.01 per transaction.  

### 4. How do I bridge assets to GateChain?  
Use HipoSwapâ€™s cross-chain bridge to transfer tokens from Ethereum, BSC, or other EVM chains to GateChain.  

### 5. Is GateChain secure?  
GateChain employs DPoS and EVM security protocols. However, always verify contract addresses and avoid untrusted dApps.  

### 6. How does GateChain compare to other blockchains?  
GateChainâ€™s 2,000 TPS and 4-second blocks outperform Ethereum (15 TPS) and Bitcoin (7 TPS), making it ideal for scalable DeFi applications.  

## Conclusion  

Adding GateChain to MetaMask unlocks access to a fast, low-cost EVM ecosystem with robust DeFi tools like HipoSwap and secure wallet features. By following this guide, you can seamlessly integrate GateChain into your workflow and leverage its unique advantages.
