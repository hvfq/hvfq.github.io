TRON is a decentralized platform designed to create a global entertainment network, enabling content creators to bypass intermediaries like Apple Store and Google Play. This blockchain ecosystem offers users a free and secure environment for hosting, storing, and distributing digital content such as photos, audio, and videos.  

At its core, TRON operates using its native cryptocurrency, TRONIX (TRX), which serves as the primary medium of exchange within the network.
